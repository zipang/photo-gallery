## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.astro
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun i  `                 | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`                 | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`             | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun astro ...`           | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun import medias`       | Import media from source directory               |

## üìÅ Media Import Process

The gallery generator uses a media import script to process your photos and generate the gallery content:

```bash
# Import media from a specific directory
bun import /path/to/your/photos

# Or set the MEDIA_DIR environment variable
MEDIA_DIR=/path/to/your/photos bun import
```

The import script will:
1. Scan your media directory for photos and videos
2. Extract EXIF metadata from images
3. Copy optimized versions for a vignette and the full-size image in the local `assets/` folder
4. Create markdown files with gallery metadata inside `src/content/`
